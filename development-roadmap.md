## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
- **Bedrock API Limitations**: Have fallback text-to-speech options
- **MetaHuman Performance**: Implement aggressive LOD systems
- **API Rate Limits**: Implement robust caching and request queuing
- **Speech Recognition Accuracy**: Provide visual feedback and confirmation

### Timeline Risks
- **Complex Integration Issues**: Allocate buffer time in each phase
- **Third-party API Changes**: Monitor API documentation and have alternatives
- **Performance Issues**: Start optimization early in development
- **Scope Creep**: Maintain strict feature prioritization
